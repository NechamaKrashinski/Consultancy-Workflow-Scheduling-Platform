# 🚀 Consultancy Workflow & Scheduling Platform


### 🌟 Project Overview

A full-stack, enterprise-grade application engineered to manage the complete lifecycle of B2B appointments between Clients, Consultants, and Admins. This platform utilizes a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system and a **State-Driven Workflow** to ensure secure and efficient service delivery.

### ✨ Key Features

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implementation of secure access separation for three distinct user roles: Client, Consultant, and Administrator.
* **State-Driven Workflow:** Logic designed to manage the appointment lifecycle (Request, Pending, Confirmed, Rejected), requiring dual approval for status changes.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Advanced client-side filtering capabilities, allowing users to search and sort consultants by expertise (Taxonomy) and real-time availability.
* **Secure API:** Robust RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express**, secured using **JWT** authentication and **Bcrypt** for password hashing.
* **Admin Management:** Dedicated dashboard allowing administrators to onboard new consultants and dynamically link them to specific service areas.
